<P><FONT color=#000000>Every now and then I undertake the sobering exercise of 
examining the academic profession. Why this usually seems to follow a period of 
great unproductivity has eluded me so far, but no doubt there must be some 
correlation and sooner or later I will write a profound paper on this, suitably 
titled - "The interaction of failure and thought - a time series perspective" 
which will no doubt revolutionize the econometric literature in this area. Come 
to think of it, its pretty obvious, one cannot both think and work at the same 
time. If it were possible, academics would not then be able to look upon the 
'working classes' with the disdain we currently do. Those who can, do, and we 
pity them for it. Those of us who cant, teach, I am afraid. <BR></FONT>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Nothing I ever said was important till I became an 
academic. Now everything I say is the MOST important, by definition. My deeper 
understanding of issues has shown me that people make incorrect statements all 
the time, especially other academics. I fail to understand this. I also find 
that for some reason the ones making the most meaningless assertions appear to 
be working in my specific sub field. I am in the process of remedying this, and 
will soon edit my own journal to ensure that the rot does not spread. I will 
charge very heavy submission fees so as to deter deviant thinkers and to access 
the best referees that money can buy. <BR></FONT>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Last week I was pondering the role of academic journals, 
and it amazed me how similar the process was to that of wine making. I was 
browsing my latest issue of "The Retrospective of Financial Analysis" and 
reading the abstract of a paper titled "Omega is Dead: Why Size Dominates Higher 
Order Moments, A Multicentury Analysis" I was struck by the fact that this paper 
had been revised only sixteen times. Surely the editor knew the authors well. 
Standards were slipping. I remember a time when papers were never submitted and 
published in the same decade. Yes, its so much like the making of good wine - 
take your time and let the referee jump on the paper. I recall with fondness the 
manuscript submission instructions - "…if papers are not vague enough to be 
revised several times, we consider them unpublishable..". Acknowledgments are 
truly a fine art, and authors will readily complement at least fifty people (in 
descending order of seniority) on their assistance in eliminating all the 
terribly useless original ideas from the paper, leaving thereby only the 
mistakes, which of course are completely their responsibility. <BR></FONT>
<P><FONT color=#000000>There are two kinds of academics: theoretical ones and 
empirical ones. The theoretical academic will make up a hypothetical situation 
(just for fun) and then develop all the machinery to prove that such a purported 
situation must be false. The more famous of such results are called 
'impossibility' or 'irrelevance' theorems. This is definitely getting somewhere, 
because by circumscribing falsehood, we must be nearer the truth (in a relative 
sense, a la Einstein). Theorists are in a perpetual search for the truth. Having 
found it, they will then explain it to us ordinary folk in a mystical and 
mysterious way, in special journals in which data is forbidden. <BR></FONT>
<P><FONT color=#000000>The empirical academic is more down-to-earth. In fact he 
is so down to earth that he is perpetually with his nose to the ground sniffing 
for data points. Once he has collected enough data, he will take gobs of it and 
throw it into neatly ordered tables with an even number of rows. He will call 
the odd numbered rows 'parameters' and the even numbered rows 't-stats'. The 
most popular game these academics play is called "Magic Number 2". They will 
keep throwing numbers at tables until almost all even numbered rows have numbers 
greater than 2. Then they will write a paper describing how many hours it took 
to collect the data points and how at the first throw, the table came out just 
great. This practice is called econometrics. Sometimes, not having control over 
the data, the academic realizes that he just cant win the game of MN2. He then 
decides to become a theorist. But the more resourceful ones decide to go the 
"non-parametric route" which is just another word for just making up the data. 
This takes great skill. <BR></FONT>
<P><FONT color=#000000>New empirical techniques are being discovered every day, 
and data which refused to confess in the past is now lining up neatly in the 
even numbered rows. Without exception, a new technique is usually broader in 
scope and the profession instantly applies it to all the data sets that exist. 
This has been known to speed up the journal process substantially, but is often 
looked down upon as 'new wine in an old bottle'. However, there is almost 
universal agreement that this is more efficient than gathering new data, 
especially since it is well known that the answers remain the same anyway. 
<BR></FONT>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Every now and then, despite ones best efforts to keep the 
writing vague, one makes the mistake of submitting a paper to a journal which is 
clearly too focused to be published. Like just yesterday I received this 
rejection letter…<BR></FONT>
<P><FONT color=#000000>" Dear Sir,</FONT> 
<P><FONT color=#000000>I enclose the referee report on your paper. The referee 
finds that the paper is clearly not involved enough to be published at a journal 
of repute such as ours. You will notice that the report is incomplete which is a 
clear indication of the fact that the referee did not think it worthwhile going 
on. In verbal communication, he indicated to me that your paper would be better 
suited to a practitioner journal where your audience would be substantially 
larger, and would probably have the time to read your work. We wish you success 
in your endeavors and encourage you to submit your more confusing work to 
us…"<BR></FONT>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Sometimes I will get lucky and receive what is known as a 
"revise and resubmit" (R&amp;R, but not in the usual sense). This is a positive 
signal requiring you to redo your work by throwing numbers at tables using 
several suggested techniques. The range and sophistication of the suggestions is 
truly mind boggling. Take the ordinary over-educated, easy-going person and make 
him referee a journal paper - it will convert him into the most imaginative 
human being of all time. Here is the solution to the declining school system: 
make referee duty compulsory. <BR></FONT>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Despite the great things about academics, there is a dark 
side to it as well. The ugliest are turf battles. Every once in a while someone 
will found an area so confusing that only he can understand it. People will 
speak of him in great awe, and yet there will appear renegades who will try and 
make sense of the paradigm, which would totally destroy its value. Or even 
worse, someone may try to develop a competing, even more confusing paradigm. 
These turf battles are major events in the life of an academic, demanding such 
strenuous effort that it takes a severe toll on the person, necessitating long 
periods of rest. Fortunately, we have a system addresses this problem - its 
called 'tenure'. It is the system's way of saying - "enough!". <BR></FONT>
<P><FONT color=#000000>I truly love academia, don't 
you?<BR><BR></FONT></P></BODY></HTML>
